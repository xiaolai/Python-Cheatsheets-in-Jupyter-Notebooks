    "The use of a Virtual Environment is to test python code in encapsulated environments, and to also avoid filling the base Python installation with libraries we might use for only one project.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Install virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "\n",
    "   Anything we install now will be specific to this project. And available to the projects we connect to this environment.\n",

    "   To bind our virtualenv with our current working directory we simply enter:\n",
